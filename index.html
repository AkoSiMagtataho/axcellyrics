 <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>

        <ul> 
             <li>[Verse 1: Justin Bieber] </br>
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know </br>
What else can we do when we're feelin' low? </br>
So take a deep breath and let it go
 </br>
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
 
</li>

            <li>And if you feel you're sinking </br>
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you </br>
And although time may take us into different places </br>
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know </br>
</li>

  <li>
  I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight </br>
I won't let go </br>
I'll be your lifeline tonight
</li> 

 <li>Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?  </br>
It's how we learn and how we grow </br>
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old </br>
You shouldn't be fighting on your own
 
          </li>
<li>And if you feel you're sinking </br>
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you </br>
And although time may take us into different places </br>
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
          </li>
          <li>I won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no, no, no, no) </br>
I'll be your lifeline tonight </br>
I won't let go </br>
I'll be your lifeline tonight
          </li>
          <li>
           [MØ:] </br>
Come on, come on </br>
Save me from my rocking boat </br>
I just want to stay afloat </br>
I'm all alone </br>
And I hope, I hope </br>
Someone is gonna take me home </br>
Somewhere I can rest my soul </br>
I need to know 
 
          </li>
<li>[Justin Bieber & MØ:] </br>
You won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no, no, no, no) </br>
I'll be your lifeline tonight </br>
You won't let go </br>
I'll be your lifeline tonight </br>

[Justin Bieber:] </br>
I won't let go </br>
I won't let go   
          </li>
